# **currency_exchanger**
Project Initiated: 2020-11-20<br>
Updated: 2020-11-27
## **Project Description**
This project allows the user to select an input currency with "dollar" amount, and an output currency.  The website will make an API call to https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ to retrieve the most up to date exchange rate information. It will provide the user with the current exchange rate between the selected currencies as a number, as well as calculate the value of the "dollar" amount in the new currency.

To run this website program on a local computer, the user should use their own API key, which can be obtained at https://www.exchangerate-api.com/. Insturctions for how to obtain and 'install' this key are provided in the Installation Instructions below.

Please note that the online version of this project has a limited number or API calls per month.  If this maximum number of API calls is reached, the program will not run as expected.
## **Required for Use**
* A browser that can run HTML5 is required.
* An exchangerate-api.com API key (if you want to run the program on your own computer).
## **Installation Instructions**

Follow the link, enter your email address, and click the large blue "Get Free Key" button.  You will then be provided your own personal API key for use with this project. Make sure to look for a verification email from exchangerate-api.com. If you do not verify your email address with them, your API key will become invalid after a few hours.
