## **Project Description**
This project allows the user to select an input currency with "dollar" amount, and an output currency.  The website will make an API call to https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ to retrieve the most up to date exchange rate information. It will provide the user with the current exchange rate between the selecte currencies as a number, as well as calculating the value of the inputed dollar amount in the new currency.

To run this website program on a local computer, the user should use their own API key, which can be obtained at https://www.exchangerate-api.com/.  Insturctions for how to obtain and 'install' this key are provided in the Installation Instructions below.
